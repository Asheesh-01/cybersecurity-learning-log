# Day 12 – Communication Models

## Topics Covered
- Basic communication model
- Sender and receiver roles
- Message encoding and decoding
- Communication channels
- Noise and interference

## Explanation
A communication model explains how information is transferred from one entity to another in a structured manner.

The sender creates and encodes a message, which is transmitted through a communication channel to the receiver.

The receiver decodes the message, and noise or interference may affect the communication during transmission.

## Why This Matters in Cybersecurity
Understanding communication models helps analyze data flow in networks.
Attackers often target communication paths to intercept or manipulate data.
Secure communication depends on clear and reliable transmission models.

## My Key Takeaway
Communication models are the foundation of secure data exchange.
