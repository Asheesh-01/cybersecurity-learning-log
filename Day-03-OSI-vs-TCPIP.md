# Day 03 - OSI Model vs TCP/IP Model

## Topics Covered
- OSI model layers
- TCP/IP model layers
- Differences between OSI and TCP/IP

## OSI Model (7 Layers)
1. Physical
2. Data Link
3. Network
4. Transport
5. Session
6. Presentation
7. Application

The OSI model is mainly used for learning and understanding how networks work.

## TCP/IP Model (4 Layers)
1. Network Access
2. Internet
3. Transport
4. Application

The TCP/IP model is used in real-world internet communication.

## Key Differences
- OSI has 7 layers, TCP/IP has 4 layers.
- OSI is theoretical, TCP/IP is practical.
- OSI helps in learning, TCP/IP helps in implementation.

## Why This Matters in Cybersecurity
Cyber attacks, packet analysis, and network troubleshooting depend on understanding these layers.

## My Key Takeaway
Without understanding OSI and TCP/IP models, network security analysis is incomplete.
