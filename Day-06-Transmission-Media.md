# Day 06 – Transmission Media

## Topics Covered
- Guided transmission media
- Unguided transmission media
- Copper cables
- Fiber optic cables
- Wireless communication

## Explanation
Transmission media is the physical path through which data travels from one device to another. It can be wired or wireless depending on the technology used.

Guided media includes cables like twisted pair, coaxial cable, and fiber optic cable. These provide controlled and secure data transmission.

Unguided media uses air as the medium such as radio waves, microwaves, and infrared. It is flexible but more vulnerable to interference.

## Why This Matters in Cybersecurity
Attackers can tap physical cables to steal data.
Wireless media is more vulnerable to interception.
Understanding media helps design secure networks.

## My Key Takeaway
Security starts from the physical transmission layer.
