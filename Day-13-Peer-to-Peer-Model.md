# Day 13 – Peer to Peer Model

## Topics Covered
- Definition of Peer to Peer model
- Characteristics of P2P networks
- Advantages of Peer to Peer architecture
- Limitations of Peer to Peer model
- Common real-world examples

## Explanation
The Peer to Peer model is a network architecture where all connected devices act as both clients and servers. There is no central authority controlling communication.

Each peer can directly request and provide services or resources to other peers. This makes the network decentralized and flexible.

Peer to Peer systems are commonly used for file sharing, distributed computing, and blockchain-based applications.

## Why This Matters in Cybersecurity
Decentralization reduces single points of failure.
P2P networks require strong trust and verification mechanisms.
They are widely used in modern attack and defense techniques.

## My Key Takeaway
Peer to Peer models enable decentralized communication but demand stronger security controls.
