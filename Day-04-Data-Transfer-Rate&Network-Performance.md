# Day 04 – Data Transfer Rate & Network Performance

## Topics Covered
- Data transfer rate
- Bandwidth
- Throughput
- Latency
- Packet loss

## Data Transfer Rate
Data transfer rate is the amount of data transmitted per unit time.  
It is measured in bps, Kbps, Mbps, and Gbps.

## Bandwidth
Bandwidth is the maximum capacity of a network to carry data.

## Throughput
Throughput is the actual data successfully transferred.  
It is always less than or equal to bandwidth.

## Latency
Latency is the time delay in communication, measured in milliseconds.

## Packet Loss
Packet loss happens when data packets fail to reach destination.

## Key Differences
- Bandwidth = Maximum capacity  
- Throughput = Actual speed  
- Latency = Delay  
- Packet loss = Missing data  

## Why This Matters in Cybersecurity
Network performance analysis helps in:
- Detecting DDoS attacks  
- Identifying abnormal traffic  
- Troubleshooting network issues  

## My Key Takeaway
Real network performance depends on throughput, latency, and packet loss together — not just bandwidth.
