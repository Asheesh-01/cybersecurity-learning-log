# Day 39 – Session Layer
## Cybersecurity Learning Journey

The **Session Layer (Layer 5 of the OSI Model)** is responsible for establishing, managing, and terminating communication sessions between applications.

---

## 🔹 Core Responsibilities

### 1. Session Establishment
- Initiates communication between two devices
- Performs session handshake

### 2. Session Management
- Maintains active sessions
- Controls dialog (who sends data and when)
- Adds checkpoints for recovery

### 3. Session Termination
- Gracefully closes connections
- Frees up system resources

---

## 🔐 Security Importance

The Session Layer plays a key role in:

- Authentication session handling
- Session timeout enforcement
- Preventing session hijacking
- Managing secure token exchange

---

## 🚨 Common Attacks Targeting the Session Layer

- Session Hijacking
- Session Fixation
- Cookie Theft
- Replay Attacks

---

## 🌍 Real-World Examples

- HTTPS login sessions
- Online banking sessions
- Remote desktop sessions
- API token-based authentication

---

## 🛡 Why It Matters in Cybersecurity

Without secure session management:

- Attackers can impersonate users
- Credentials may be reused maliciously
- Authentication systems can be bypassed

Strong session controls help ensure secure and trusted communication between systems.
