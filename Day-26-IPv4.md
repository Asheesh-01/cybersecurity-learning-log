## What is IPv4
IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4) is a 32-bit addressing system used to identify devices on a network.

Each device connected to a network is assigned a unique IPv4 address.

Example:
192.168.10.5

---

## IPv4 Address Structure
IPv4 uses 32 bits divided into 4 octets (8 bits each).

Format:
X.X.X.X  

Each octet ranges from 0 to 255.

---

## IPv4 Format
Written in dotted decimal notation.

Example:
192.168.1.1

---

## IPv4 Classes

Class A  
Range: 1.0.0.0 – 126.255.255.255  

Class B  
Range: 128.0.0.0 – 191.255.255.255  

Class C  
Range: 192.0.0.0 – 223.255.255.255  

Class D  
Used for multicast  

Class E  
Reserved for research

## Public vs Private IPv4

Private IP Ranges:
- 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255  
- 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255  
- 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255  

Public IPs are routable on the internet.

## Security Risks
- IP spoofing  
- DDoS attacks  
- Network scanning  
- Man-in-the-middle  

---

## Protection Mechanisms
- Firewalls  
- VPN  
- IDS/IPS  
- Network segmentation  
- Access control lists  

---

## Why IPv4 Matters in Cybersecurity
Most attacks involve IPv4 traffic.  
Understanding IPv4 helps in monitoring, filtering, and tracing malicious activity.

---

## My Key Takeaway
IPv4 is the backbone of modern networking and cybersecurity.
