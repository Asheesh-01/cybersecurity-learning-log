## Explanation
Web hosting is a service that allows websites and web applications to be accessible over the internet. Hosting providers store website files such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and databases on servers that are connected to the internet 24/7.

When a user enters a website URL in a browser, a request is sent to the hosting server using HTTP or HTTPS. The web server processes the request and delivers the requested content back to the user.

A web server is a software (such as Apache, Nginx, or IIS) running on a physical or virtual machine. It listens for incoming requests, applies security rules, and serves content efficiently.

### Types of Web Hosting
- **Shared Hosting**: Multiple websites share the same server resources. It is cost-effective but less secure.
- **VPS (Virtual Private Server)**: A virtualized server with dedicated resources, offering better control and security.
- **Dedicated Hosting**: A complete physical server dedicated to one organization, providing maximum performance and security.
- **Cloud Hosting**: Uses multiple servers to balance load and improve availability and scalability.

Each hosting type differs in performance, cost, control, scalability, and security level.

Hosting infrastructure includes physical servers, virtualization layers, storage systems, networking components, operating systems, and security tools such as firewalls and monitoring systems.

## Why This Matters in Cybersecurity
Hosting servers are prime targets for cyber attacks.
Misconfigured servers can expose sensitive data.
Weak hosting security can lead to website defacement and malware hosting.
Secure hosting reduces attack surface and improves resilience.

## My Key Takeaway
Secure web hosting is the foundation of reliable and trustworthy online services.
