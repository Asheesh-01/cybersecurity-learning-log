# Day 08 – DHCP

## Topics Covered
- DHCP purpose
- DHCP server and client
- DHCP message process
- IP lease concept
- DHCP security risks

## Explanation
DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. It automatically assigns IP addresses to devices in a network.

It provides IP address, subnet mask, gateway, and DNS without manual configuration.

DHCP works using a request and response process between client and server.

## Why This Matters in Cybersecurity
Attackers can use rogue DHCP servers to redirect traffic.

DHCP logs help in network investigation.

Secure DHCP prevents network misconfiguration attacks.

## My Key Takeaway
DHCP is critical for both network efficiency and security monitoring.
