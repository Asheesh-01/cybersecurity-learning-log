An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to a device on a network.

IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses while IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses for larger scalability.

Public IPs are used on the internet, while private IPs are used inside local networks.

## Why This Matters in Cybersecurity
Attackers, defenders, and logs all rely on IP addresses for tracking and protection.

## My Key Takeaway
Understanding IP addressing is essential for cybersecurity investigations.
