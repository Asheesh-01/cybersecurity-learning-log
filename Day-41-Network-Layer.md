# Day 41 – Network Layer
## Cybersecurity Learning Journey

The **Network Layer (Layer 3 of the OSI Model)** is responsible for logical addressing and routing data across networks.

It ensures that packets travel from source to destination using the best available path.

---

## 🔹 Core Responsibilities

### 1. Logical Addressing
- Assigns IP addresses
- Identifies source and destination devices

### 2. Routing
- Determines best path for packet delivery
- Uses routing tables

### 3. Packet Forwarding
- Transfers packets between networks
- Works with routers

### 4. Fragmentation
- Breaks packets into smaller pieces if needed

---

## 🔹 Key Protocols

- IP (Internet Protocol)
- ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
- ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
- OSPF, RIP, BGP (Routing Protocols)

---

## 🔐 Security Importance

The Network Layer plays a major role in:

- Firewall filtering (IP-based rules)
- Detecting suspicious traffic patterns
- Preventing IP spoofing
- Monitoring network flows

---

## 🚨 Common Attacks

- IP Spoofing
- ICMP Flood (Ping Flood)
- Routing Attacks
- Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)

---

## 🛡 Why It Matters in Cybersecurity

Monitoring Layer 3 helps:

- Detect abnormal IP behavior
- Prevent unauthorized access
- Secure routing infrastructure
- Support threat intelligence analysis
