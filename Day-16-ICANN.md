## Explanation
ICANN stands for Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. It is a global organization responsible for managing the internet’s unique identifiers.

ICANN coordinates domain names, IP addresses, and protocol parameters so that users can access websites reliably from anywhere in the world.

Without ICANN, the internet would not function in a unified and organized manner. It ensures that every domain name and IP address is unique.

## Why This Matters in Cybersecurity

Prevents domain conflicts and misuse.
Supports global trust in internet infrastructure.

ICANN is a backbone organization that keeps the internet stable and secure.
