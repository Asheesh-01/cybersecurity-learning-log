# Day 15 – Network Topology

## Topics Covered
- Definition of network topology
- Physical vs logical topology
- Common topology types
- Advantages and disadvantages
- Real-world usage examples

## Explanation
Network topology refers to the arrangement or layout of devices and connections in a network. It defines how computers, servers, and other devices are interconnected.

Physical topology describes the actual physical connections, while logical topology describes how data flows inside the network.

Common topologies include bus, star, ring, mesh, tree, and hybrid. Each topology has different strengths, weaknesses, and use cases depending on size, cost, reliability, and performance needs.

Choosing the correct topology helps ensure efficient communication, scalability, and easier troubleshooting.

## Why This Matters in Cybersecurity
Topology affects how attacks spread across a network.
Some topologies provide better isolation and monitoring.
Understanding layout helps design secure architectures.

## My Key Takeaway
Network topology plays a critical role in building secure and reliable networks.
