## What is an IP Address
An IP address is a unique numerical identifier assigned to every device connected to a network.  
It allows devices to locate and communicate with each other.

Example (IPv4):
192.168.1.1

---

## Purpose of IP Address
- Identify devices
- Enable communication
- Route traffic correctly
- Support internet connectivity

---

## IPv4
- 32-bit address
- Written in decimal format
- Example: 192.168.10.5

## IPv6
- 128-bit address
- Written in hexadecimal
- Example: 2001:db8::1
- Created to solve IPv4 exhaustion

---

## Public IP
- Assigned by ISP
- Used on the internet
- Unique globally

## Private IP
- Used inside local networks
- Not reachable from internet directly
- Common ranges:
  - 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255
  - 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255
  - 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255

---

## Static IP
- Manually assigned
- Does not change

## Dynamic IP
- Assigned by DHCP
- Changes over time

---

## Security Risks
- IP spoofing
- DDoS attacks
- Network scanning
- Tracking users

---

## Protection Methods
- Firewalls
- VPN
- IDS/IPS
- Network segmentation
- Strong access controls

---

## Why IP Address Matters in Cybersecurity
Most attacks involve IP addresses.  
Understanding IP helps in detecting, blocking, and tracing threats.

---

## My Key Takeaway
IP addressing is the foundation of networking and cybersecurity.
