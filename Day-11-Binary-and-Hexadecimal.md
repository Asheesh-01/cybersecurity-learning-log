## Topics Covered
- Binary number system
- Hexadecimal number system
- Number conversions
- Usage in cybersecurity

## Binary Number System
Binary uses only two digits: 0 and 1.  
Computers use binary because electronic circuits operate in ON and OFF states.

Example:  
Decimal 6 = Binary 110  

## Hexadecimal Number System
Hexadecimal uses 16 symbols:  
0–9 and A–F  

It is used to represent long binary values in a shorter readable form.

Example:  
Binary 11111111 = Hex FF

## Why Important in Cybersecurity
Understanding binary and hexadecimal helps in:
- Network troubleshooting
- Packet analysis
- Malware research
- Digital forensics

## Key Takeaway
Binary and hexadecimal are the core language of computer systems and cybersecurity.
