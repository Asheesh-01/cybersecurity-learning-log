# Day 14 – Client Server Model

## Topics Covered
- Definition of Client Server model
- Roles of client and server
- Request and response process
- Advantages of Client Server architecture
- Limitations of Client Server model

## Explanation
The Client Server model is a network architecture where clients request services and servers provide those services.

Clients initiate communication by sending requests, and servers respond with the required data or resource.

This model is widely used in web browsing, email communication, and enterprise applications.

## Why This Matters in Cybersecurity
Central servers are common attack targets.
Access control and authentication are critical.
Monitoring is easier in centralized environments.

## My Key Takeaway
Client Server architecture provides control and scalability but must be strongly secured.
