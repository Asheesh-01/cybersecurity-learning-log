# Day 27 – IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6)

## What is IPv6?
IPv6 is the latest version of Internet Protocol designed to replace IPv4.
It uses 128-bit addresses to uniquely identify devices on a network.

---

## IPv6 Address Format
- Written in hexadecimal
- 8 groups separated by colons (:)
- Each group is 16 bits

Example:
2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

Shortened form:
2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334

## Key Features of IPv6
- 128-bit address space
- No NAT required
- Auto-configuration
- Better routing efficiency
- Built-in IPsec support

## IPv4 vs IPv6

| Feature | IPv4 | IPv6 |
|------|------|------|
| Address Size | 32-bit | 128-bit |
| Format | Decimal | Hexadecimal |
| Address Count | Limited | Extremely large |
| NAT | Required | Not required |

---

## Common IPv6 Address Types
- Unicast – One-to-one
- Multicast – One-to-many
- Anycast – Nearest device

---

## Security Perspective
- Harder to scan due to large address space
- IPsec supported natively
- Misconfiguration still a major risk

---

## Why IPv6 Matters in Cybersecurity
- Backbone of modern internet
- Required for cloud & IoT
- Strong foundation for secure networking
